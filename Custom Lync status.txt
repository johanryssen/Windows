[1]     Create a XML file on your desktop using your favourite text editor and call it Presence.xml.

[2]     Paste the following text into that file, making sure you don’t get smart quotes by accident.

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <customStates
     xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/09/2005/communicator/customStates"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://schemas.microsoft.com/09/2005/communicator/customStates"
     >
             <customState ID="1" availability="online">
                      <activity LCID="1033">TeleCommute</activity>
             </customState>
             <customState ID="2" availability="busy">
                      <activity LCID="1033">In a WebEx meeting</activity>
             </customState>
                <customState ID="2" availability="busy">
                      <activity LCID="1033">Change Control</activity>
             </customState>
     </customStates>

[3] Launch REGEDIT
     Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Communicator

[4]     First, you will need to tell Lync it can accept a Presence.xml file without using HTTPS.
     Create a REG_DWORD called EnableSIPHighSecurityMode.
     Set that value to 0.
     If you already have that string present, just edit the value to 0.

[5]     Next create a REG_SZ (string value) called CustomStateURL
     Give it a value of:
     "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Lync\Presence.xml" if you are running 64bit
     "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Lync\Presence.xml”  if you are running 32bit.
     In either case, don’t include the quotes.

[6]     Then, create a REG_DWORD called EnableAppearOffline
     Give it a value of 1.

[7]     Copy the Presence.xml file to whichever path from step [5] is appropriate for you.

[8]     Exit and relaunch Lync, and see your new status options.
