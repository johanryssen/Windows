==================

There is another option.
Before you ran chntpw in Debian, you had to mount the drive with a command like:
ntfs-3g /dev/sda3 /media/sda3
(That assumes that you already created /media/sda3.)
If you had used the remove_hiberfile option, such as:
ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda3 /media/sda3
then ntfs-3g would have deleted the Windows hibernation file hiberfil.sys for you,
which would have solved your problem.
