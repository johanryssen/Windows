When you try to run a PowerShell with an execution policy set to:
- Restricted
- Remote Signed or
- All Signed


# Fix:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned


---------------


# RESTRICTED
Restricted is the default policy set for Windows client computers.
If you are using PowerShell for the first time, your default policy would probably be set to restrict all the scripts.
You can still execute individual commands in a terminal, but not a script file.
The restriction includes any file ending with .ps1xml, .psm1 or .ps1.


# UNRESTRICTED
Unrestricted allows you to run any script however, it warns you before execution if the script is downloaded from the internet.
This policy is usually the default for any non-windows devices.


# REMOTE SIGNED
Remote Signed policy allows you to run any script that is either
(a) digitally signed or 
(b) any script written on your local computer with or without a signature.

If a script is downloaded from the internet and not signed, you would need to unblock the file.
You can do so by right-clicking on the file and choosing Properties.
Or, you could use the Unblock-File PowerShell cmdlet for that particular script file.

Using a Remote signed policy would be an ideal option when running a script downloaded from the internet.


# ALL SIGNED
All signed requires all the scripts to be signed digitally by a trusted publisher.
This includes the scripts downloaded from the internet and written locally on your computer.
