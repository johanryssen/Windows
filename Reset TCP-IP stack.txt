netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt

When you run the reset command, it rewrites two registry keys that are used by TCP/IP.
This has the same result as removing and reinstalling the protocol.
The reset command rewrites the following two registry keys:

SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DHCP\Parameters\

To run the manual command successfully, you must specify a file name for the log, in which the actions that netsh takes will be recorded.
When you run the manual command, TCP/IP is reset and the actions that were taken are recorded in the log file, known as resetlog.txt in this article.
