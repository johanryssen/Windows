1. Open up the MS Paint and choose "File" from the toolbar menu.
Next, pick "Open" and locate the JPEG file to convert to an icon.

2. Choose "File" from the toolbar menu and then "Save As."

3. Type in the name of the file in the "File Name" drop-down list box.
However, type ".ICO" at the end of the file name.
Keep the "Save As Type" as JPEG. Click "Save."
(NOTE: Do not be alarmed that you are first saving it as a JPEG type for now, because entering the ICO extension in the file name will activate the conversion.)

4. Choose "File" and "Open" from the toolbar menu. Select "ICO(*.ICO)" from the "Files As Type" drop-down list box.

5. Click on the icon file and press "Open."
